# Windows (WSL)

Run OpenCode on Windows using WSL for the best experience.

While OpenCode can run directly on Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for the best experience. WSL provides a Linux environment that works seamlessly with OpenCode’s features.

Why WSL?

WSL offers better file system performance, full terminal support, and compatibility with development tools that OpenCode relies on.

## [Setup](#setup)

1. **Install WSL**  
If you haven’t already, [install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) using the official Microsoft guide.
2. **Install OpenCode in WSL**  
Once WSL is set up, open your WSL terminal and install OpenCode using one of the [installation methods](../docs.md).  
Terminal window  
```  
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash  
```
3. **Use OpenCode from WSL**  
Navigate to your project directory (access Windows files via `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, etc.) and run OpenCode.  
Terminal window  
```  
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/project  
opencode  
```

## [Desktop App + WSL Server](#desktop-app--wsl-server)

If you prefer using the OpenCode Desktop app but want to run the server in WSL:

1. **Start the server in WSL** with `--hostname 0.0.0.0` to allow external connections:  
Terminal window  
```  
opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096  
```
2. **Connect the Desktop app** to `http://localhost:4096`

Note

If `localhost` does not work in your setup, connect using the WSL IP address instead (from WSL: `hostname -I`) and use `http://<wsl-ip>:4096`.

Caution

When using `--hostname 0.0.0.0`, set `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` to secure the server.

Terminal window

```

OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-password opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0


```

## [Web Client + WSL](#web-client--wsl)

For the best web experience on Windows:

1. **Run `opencode web` in the WSL terminal** rather than PowerShell:  
Terminal window  
```  
opencode web --hostname 0.0.0.0  
```
2. **Access from your Windows browser** at `http://localhost:<port>` (OpenCode prints the URL)

Running `opencode web` from WSL ensures proper file system access and terminal integration while still being accessible from your Windows browser.

## [Accessing Windows Files](#accessing-windows-files)

WSL can access all your Windows files through the `/mnt/` directory:

* `C:` drive → `/mnt/c/`
* `D:` drive → `/mnt/d/`
* And so on…

Example:

Terminal window

```

cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/project

opencode


```

Tip

For the smoothest experience, consider cloning/copying your repo into the WSL filesystem (for example under `~/code/`) and running OpenCode there.

## [Tips](#tips)

* Keep OpenCode running in WSL for projects stored on Windows drives - file access is seamless
* Use VS Code’s [WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) alongside OpenCode for an integrated development workflow
* Your OpenCode config and sessions are stored within the WSL environment at `~/.local/share/opencode/`
