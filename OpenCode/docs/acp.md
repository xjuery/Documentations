# ACP Support

Use OpenCode in any ACP-compatible editor.

OpenCode supports the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) or (ACP), allowing you to use it directly in compatible editors and IDEs.

Tip

For a list of editors and tools that support ACP, check out the [ACP progress report](https://zed.dev/blog/acp-progress-report#available-now).

ACP is an open protocol that standardizes communication between code editors and AI coding agents.

---

## [Configure](#configure)

To use OpenCode via ACP, configure your editor to run the `opencode acp` command.

The command starts OpenCode as an ACP-compatible subprocess that communicates with your editor over JSON-RPC via stdio.

Below are examples for popular editors that support ACP.

---

### [Zed](#zed)

Add to your [Zed](https://zed.dev) configuration (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

\~/.config/zed/settings.json

```

{

  "agent_servers": {

    "OpenCode": {

      "command": "opencode",

      "args": ["acp"]

    }

  }

}


```

To open it, use the `agent: new thread` action in the **Command Palette**.

You can also bind a keyboard shortcut by editing your `keymap.json`:

keymap.json

```

[

  {

    "bindings": {

      "cmd-alt-o": [

        "agent::NewExternalAgentThread",

        {

          "agent": {

            "custom": {

              "name": "OpenCode",

              "command": {

                "command": "opencode",

                "args": ["acp"]

              }

            }

          }

        }

      ]

    }

  }

]


```

---

### [JetBrains IDEs](#jetbrains-ides)

Add to your [JetBrains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/) acp.json according to the [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/acp.html):

acp.json

```

{

  "agent_servers": {

    "OpenCode": {

      "command": "/absolute/path/bin/opencode",

      "args": ["acp"]

    }

  }

}


```

To open it, use the new ‘OpenCode’ agent in the AI Chat agent selector.

---

### [Avante.nvim](#avantenvim)

Add to your [Avante.nvim](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) configuration:

```

{

  acp_providers = {

    ["opencode"] = {

      command = "opencode",

      args = { "acp" }

    }

  }

}


```

If you need to pass environment variables:

```

{

  acp_providers = {

    ["opencode"] = {

      command = "opencode",

      args = { "acp" },

      env = {

        OPENCODE_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENCODE_API_KEY")

      }

    }

  }

}


```

---

### [CodeCompanion.nvim](#codecompanionnvim)

To use OpenCode as an ACP agent in [CodeCompanion.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim), add the following to your Neovim config:

```

require("codecompanion").setup({

  interactions = {

    chat = {

      adapter = {

        name = "opencode",

        model = "claude-sonnet-4",

      },

    },

  },

})


```

This config sets up CodeCompanion to use OpenCode as the ACP agent for chat.

If you need to pass environment variables (like `OPENCODE_API_KEY`), refer to [Configuring Adapters: Environment Variables](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev/getting-started#setting-an-api-key) in the CodeCompanion.nvim documentation for full details.

## [Support](#support)

OpenCode works the same via ACP as it does in the terminal. All features are supported:

Note

Some built-in slash commands like `/undo` and `/redo` are currently unsupported.

* Built-in tools (file operations, terminal commands, etc.)
* Custom tools and slash commands
* MCP servers configured in your OpenCode config
* Project-specific rules from `AGENTS.md`
* Custom formatters and linters
* Agents and permissions system
