# Commands

Create custom commands for repetitive tasks.

Custom commands let you specify a prompt you want to run when that command is executed in the TUI.

```

/my-command


```

Custom commands are in addition to the built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`. [Learn more](tui.md).

---

## [Create command files](#create-command-files)

Create markdown files in the `commands/` directory to define custom commands.

Create `.opencode/commands/test.md`:

.opencode/commands/test.md

```

---

description: Run tests with coverage

agent: build

model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

---


Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.

Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.


```

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template.

Use the command by typing `/` followed by the command name.

```

"/test"


```

---

## [Configure](#configure)

You can add custom commands through the OpenCode config or by creating markdown files in the `commands/` directory.

---

### [JSON](#json)

Use the `command` option in your OpenCode [config](config.md):

opencode.jsonc

```

{

  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",

  "command": {

    // This becomes the name of the command

    "test": {

      // This is the prompt that will be sent to the LLM

      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.",

      // This is shown as the description in the TUI

      "description": "Run tests with coverage",

      "agent": "build",

      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

    }

  }

}


```

Now you can run this command in the TUI:

```

/test


```

---

### [Markdown](#markdown)

You can also define commands using markdown files. Place them in:

* Global: `~/.config/opencode/commands/`
* Per-project: `.opencode/commands/`

\~/.config/opencode/commands/test.md

```

---

description: Run tests with coverage

agent: build

model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

---


Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.

Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.


```

The markdown file name becomes the command name. For example, `test.md` lets you run:

```

/test


```

---

## [Prompt config](#prompt-config)

The prompts for the custom commands support several special placeholders and syntax.

---

### [Arguments](#arguments)

Pass arguments to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

.opencode/commands/component.md

```

---

description: Create a new component

---


Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with TypeScript support.

Include proper typing and basic structure.


```

Run the command with arguments:

```

/component Button


```

And `$ARGUMENTS` will be replaced with `Button`.

You can also access individual arguments using positional parameters:

* `$1` \- First argument
* `$2` \- Second argument
* `$3` \- Third argument
* And so on…

For example:

.opencode/commands/create-file.md

```

---

description: Create a new file with content

---


Create a file named $1 in the directory $2

with the following content: $3


```

Run the command:

```

/create-file config.json src "{ \"key\": \"value\" }"


```

This replaces:

* `$1` with `config.json`
* `$2` with `src`
* `$3` with `{ "key": "value" }`

---

### [Shell output](#shell-output)

Use _!`command`_ to inject [bash command](tui.md) output into your prompt.

For example, to create a custom command that analyzes test coverage:

.opencode/commands/analyze-coverage.md

```

---

description: Analyze test coverage

---


Here are the current test results:

!`npm test`


Based on these results, suggest improvements to increase coverage.


```

Or to review recent changes:

.opencode/commands/review-changes.md

```

---

description: Review recent changes

---


Recent git commits:

!`git log --oneline -10`


Review these changes and suggest any improvements.


```

Commands run in your project’s root directory and their output becomes part of the prompt.

---

### [File references](#file-references)

Include files in your command using `@` followed by the filename.

.opencode/commands/review-component.md

```

---

description: Review component

---


Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx.

Check for performance issues and suggest improvements.


```

The file content gets included in the prompt automatically.

---

## [Options](#options)

Let’s look at the configuration options in detail.

---

### [Template](#template)

The `template` option defines the prompt that will be sent to the LLM when the command is executed.

opencode.json

```

{

  "command": {

    "test": {

      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes."

    }

  }

}


```

This is a **required** config option.

---

### [Description](#description)

Use the `description` option to provide a brief description of what the command does.

opencode.json

```

{

  "command": {

    "test": {

      "description": "Run tests with coverage"

    }

  }

}


```

This is shown as the description in the TUI when you type in the command.

---

### [Agent](#agent)

Use the `agent` config to optionally specify which [agent](agents.md) should execute this command. If this is a [subagent](agents.md) the command will trigger a subagent invocation by default. To disable this behavior, set `subtask` to `false`.

opencode.json

```

{

  "command": {

    "review": {

      "agent": "plan"

    }

  }

}


```

This is an **optional** config option. If not specified, defaults to your current agent.

---

### [Subtask](#subtask)

Use the `subtask` boolean to force the command to trigger a [subagent](agents.md) invocation. This is useful if you want the command to not pollute your primary context and will **force** the agent to act as a subagent, even if `mode` is set to `primary` on the [agent](agents.md) configuration.

opencode.json

```

{

  "command": {

    "analyze": {

      "subtask": true

    }

  }

}


```

This is an **optional** config option.

---

### [Model](#model)

Use the `model` config to override the default model for this command.

opencode.json

```

{

  "command": {

    "analyze": {

      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

    }

  }

}


```

This is an **optional** config option.

---

## [Built-in](#built-in)

opencode includes several built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`; [learn more](tui.md).

Note

Custom commands can override built-in commands.

If you define a custom command with the same name, it will override the built-in command.
